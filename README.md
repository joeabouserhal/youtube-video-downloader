# youtube-video-downloader
A youtube video downloader using tkinter for the gui and pytube for downloading the videos.
but pytube seems too be outdated and doesn't work at the moment.
## To-Do:
 - change the pytube library to something else so videos are actually downloadable
 - add some features to the ui (error messages...)
 - add download location selector
